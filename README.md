# ARID1A_Mutation
Source codes for: Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms and biological implications of ARID1A C-terminal missense mutations in cancer

We combined ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to investigate the influence of ARID1D mutation on the regulatory landscape in HEK293T cells. Raw sequencing data and bed files was uploaded to GEO database. The analysis pipelines of the ATAC-seq and the ChIP-seq data can be found at: [Diffbind_ATAC.R](./Diffbind_ATAC.R), [Diffbind_CHIP.R](./Diffbind_CHIP.R). The
